= TodoService - World's least awesome REST Service for TODO

This will be a nice working TODO app by 2022..
For now it provides a trivial ToDo lister/editor for one person via REST.

Uses ../TodoDataModel for its JPA Data; do mvn install in that project first.

You need to copy config-sample.properties to config.properties, and edit it.

Assuming you're using Wildfly 8 or 9 and PostGreSQL 9, just set up the datasource and do `mvn wildfly:deploy`

== Things do do.

Move away from container-managed security so it can more easily become multi-user.

== BUGS

The only reason this is split off from TodoJSF is that Java EE doesn't allow two
login-config elements, we need FORM for the JSF and BASIC for the REST. Sigh...
