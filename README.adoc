= TodoService - World's least awesome REST Service for TODO

This will be a nice working TODO app by 2027.
For now it provides a trivial ToDo lister/editor for one person via REST.

Uses ../TodoDataModel for its JPA Data; do mvn install in that project first.

You need to copy config-sample.properties to config.properties, and edit it.

Assuming you're using Wildfly and PostGreSQL, just set up the datasource and do `mvn wildfly:deploy`

== Things do do.

Bring in signup (adding "signup code required"), maybe from cookbookweb?

== BUGS

Originally split off from TodoJSF due to login-config issues.

The reason I continue its development is, duh, mobile.
