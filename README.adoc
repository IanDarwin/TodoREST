= TodoService - World's least awesome REST Service for TODO

This will be a nice working TODO app by 2027.
For now it provides a trivial ToDo lister/editor for one person via REST.

Uses ../TodoDataModel for its JPA Data; do mvn install in that project first.

You need to copy config-sample.properties to config.properties, and edit it.

Assuming you're using Wildfly and PostGreSQL, just set up the datasource and do `mvn wildfly:deploy`

== Things do do.

Move away from container-managed security so it can more easily become multi-user.
In fact, so it can be used at all right now.

== BUGS

The reason this originally split off from TodoJSF is that Java EE doesn't allow two
login-config elements, we need FORM for the JSF and BASIC for the REST. Sigh...

The reason I continue its development is, duh, mobile.
